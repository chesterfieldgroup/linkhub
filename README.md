#Chesterfield Insurance Brokers Link Hub
This software acts as a point to serve individual websites for each employee within the company. This website was designed given a re-design of business cards to which QR codes are implemented to point to employees websites. The website features JavaScript that fetches employee data from a JSON file, and contains functions to populate the single index.html file and also facilates the creation and download of a vCard to allow users to quickly and easily import contact details, instead of entering details manually. The code features a function to dynamically change a image to Base64 given this is the only working format that vCard accepts for images.

The styling is consistent and has been written with Bootstrap to ensure that the website is responsive.
